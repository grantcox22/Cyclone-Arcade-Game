# Cyclone-Arcade-Game
This is a game that functions similarly to the Cyclone arcade game, those arcade games where lights go around a circle and you must hit the button on the right light to win the maximum amount of tickets, it contains two buttons, five leds, and an Arduino Nano, along with bread boards, resistors and an assortment of wires.
